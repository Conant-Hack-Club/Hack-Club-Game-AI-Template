# Game AI Template

## Steps

1. Go into script.js and game.js and add in code wherever there is a "TODO"
2. In order to make the AI learn the fastest, mess around with the following:
    - fitness function (in game.js)
    - number of AI (in script.js) 
    - GAME AI SETTINGS (in script.js)
    - input value or output threshold (in game.js)
3. Change the colors, add additional information such as the fitness scores, epoch, or more.
